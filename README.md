#Brief:

App developed with Swift with SwiftUI.
Minimum deployment iOS 18.4 (I just didn't change when created a project).
Testing framework *Testing*

##Architectural decisions

Here is used standard **MVVM** pattern with dependency injection. Shared and reusable functionality moved to services that later are injected into ViewModels and other services.

##Design

Design, perhaps, is not the best but to my mind it's simple and readable. 

##Time spend

Roughly I spend **12-15** hours to build this project.

##Usage of AI
Didn't use any AI tool (except the one built in Xcode).
